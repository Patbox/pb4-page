VoxelSrv is a voxel game inspired by Minecraft, where you can build, mine and craft (not implemented yet). This game is still in early development, so many features might be not implemented yet! It support Singleplayer and Multiplayer (requires hosting own server).

Currently development has been dropped, but I want to resurect it in some way.
