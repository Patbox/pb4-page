mrpack4server is a "server launcher" that allows you to easily load and run any modpack from Modrinth
(or just using `.mrpack` format) as a Minecraft Server. This tool doesn't require any additional arguments
and can work as any other server jar (like vanilla provided one).

It can be used by anyone, from running standalone for any user to creating pre-configured jars for modpack makers.
It automatically handles all mrpack and mod loader downloading, starting the server once it's ready (for supported loaders).
