It's a library for creating server side content, that work for player's without mods or (required) resource packs! You can create blocks, items and entities, that not only will work fully on server side (and singleplayer), but also are represented on server the same as normal (vanilla/modded) ones (unlike bukkit/spigot ones, that are stored as vanilla block).

This library also should work correctly with other, non-polymer mods and PolyMC!
