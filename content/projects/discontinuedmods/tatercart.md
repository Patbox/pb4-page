This mod isn't currently actively maintaned!

Vanilla minecarts are somewhat lacking. They are one of worse transportation method in vanilla game 
and this mod tries to fix it! This mode changes minecart physics 
(with option to toggle it per minecart for people who need vanilla physics) and adds multiple new types of minecarts and rails
with their own functionality!

It's fully server side (singleplayer compatible).
