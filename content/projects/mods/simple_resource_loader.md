Simple Resource Loader is a tiny mod allowing you to add required (or optional) resource packs and data packs to your Minecraft instance, useful for any modpack or server maker. It works on clients, singleplayer and dedicated servers, without a single config file. You just need to put packs (which can be either a folder or a zip file) in correct place.
