Brewery is a Fabric/Quilt compatible mod allowing you to create alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks with cauldrons and barrels. Aside of few builtin ones, you can add any number of custom drinks with their own recipes and functionality by using datapacks. Additionally, this mod can work purely server side, allowing vanilla clients to join and use its capabilities.

While this mod is inspired/based on ideas from Sn0wStorm's Brewery plugin for bukkit, it isn't compatible with its configs/items as this one is powered by Polymer
