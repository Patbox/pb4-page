Get Off My Lawn ReServer is a take on the popular concept of player claims for Survival/Freebuild Fabric servers. 
This mod works fully server side (no client mod required!) while being compatible with major Fabric modpacks

This project is a fork of [Get Off My Lawn by Draylar](https://github.com/Draylar/get-off-my-lawn), with main focus on improving and building on top of original.
