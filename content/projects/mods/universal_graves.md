It's a simple, but really customisable grave/death chest mod! You can change how every message, block and hologram looks, how long it will be protected, if should drop items after expiring, etc. It works fully server side, so you don't need it on your client to play on servers using it. Additionally it supports singleplayer and is used by multiple big fabric modpacks.
