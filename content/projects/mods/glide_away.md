Did you ever want to glide away, but Elytra wasn't what you looked for?
Maybe you wanted something, that felt a bit more balanced?
Or maybe you just didn't want to wait until you get into the end?
If so, you might like this mod!

Glider Away! is a [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer)-powered Fabric (and Quilt) Server Side modification adding
Hang Gliders to the game! Ideal for your survival server where you play
with people who don't want to install any mods. It still does work in
singleplayer through!
