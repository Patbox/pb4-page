This mod will accelerate time while you sleep instead of skipping directly to day. When installed on a multiplayer server, the acceleration speed will scale based on the number of players asleep.

This is a fork of the [SleepWarp mod by Giggitybyte](https://modrinth.com/mod/sleep-warp), 
updating it to latest versions of Minecraft, with bug fixes, improvements and full translations support.
