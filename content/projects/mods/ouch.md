Tired of guessing how much damage entity you attacked took? Or maybe you just wanted to make fights look bit fancier? Then this mod is for you!

Ouch! is Fabric (and Quilt) server side modification powered by Polymer which adds number/text particle effect activated after entity getting damaged, dying or getting healed (by default only damage/healing is visible)! This mod is also fully configurable allowing to change the text (color and display), size, movement and visibility time, depending on predicates testing for damage type, victim (damaged entity), source (attacker or projectile) and attacker (attacker). It can also display multiple particles with different setting for same damage, allowing for extra fun messages and alike.
