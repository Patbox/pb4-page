A joke mod created for April Fools 2023. It makes every single entity (including non alive ones like Items, Armor Stands, Minecarts), use a model
based on player characted from *Among us* game. 

It works purely server side and uses Polymer Core and Polymer Virtual Entity APIs to achive that effect.
