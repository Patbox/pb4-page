Simple Update Checker is a small mod that adds in-game notification about Modrinth modpack update being available. It works for both servers and clients.

The update information is displayed in logs on server/client boot and then in other places depending on where it runs. For clients, it displays update info on main screen (on right side from modpack name/version text), refreshing every hour after the game starts. For servers, it displays it in logs after server starts and for operators on join.
