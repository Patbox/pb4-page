AnotherMC.pl was a polish Minecraft survival server. It started on december 2018 (as Boxcraft.ga and later Boxcraft.eu). It was renamed to AnotherMC with first map reset. From 1st to 3rd map it used Paper/Spigot as it's base and with 4th one switched to Fabric. It is currently on its 5th map, which is first one requiring client side mods. It doesn't have any P2W things, as it was always made for fun.

This project is no longer maintained, as my main focus shifted to mod development and Nucleoid
