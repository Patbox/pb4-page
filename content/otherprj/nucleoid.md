NucleoidMC is a minigame Minecraft server build on top of open-source mods, fabric and modern versions of Minecraft. I originally joined it in 2020. Later as contributed some maps and when I learned modding, I started contibuting code, new minigames (Destroy the Monument and Build Battle) and libraries. Currently I'm part of core team and lead of tools & library development.
